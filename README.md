# trandchat
Web based chat program using hipster web frameworks and terrible memes.
That's now.
As trandchat grows, it will evolve into a fully customizable chat
program that allows users and hosts to make their daily chat program
feel like they want, make it do what they want; and house any content
they wish to serve. By default, no logs are kept besides the start-up 
message and they port which the server is being broadcasted on.
