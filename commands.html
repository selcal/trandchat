<h2>Commands please?</h2>
<ul>
<li>/roll /rawl /jimmyrollins <br> >> Rolls a random number. If you get repeating digits you may in fact have a large penis/breasts. You will also be lauded by various figures of great internet importance like Patrick Bateman. People will tell tales about your >>88888888 GET to their children.</li>
<li>/clear /c <br> >>Clears the chat immediately on your end. Good for spam. (Daily reminder you can <i>disable 'Maximum Maymay Mode'</i> in the options if it gets out of hand.</li>
<li>/polska /sciernisko kurwa <br> >>Play a hideously low bitrate compressed version of the 'Polish National Anthem' for our fellow bracia in mother poland. (You can use <b>/c /clear</b> or the clear button (X) on the top bar to be a filthy american.</li>

<h2>How do I jump?</h2>

<h2>Past this point, you're actually interested in features:</h2>
<h3>Can I change the stylesheet to a custom made one?</h3>
<p>Hell yes you can, I'll post all of the rules and IDs of the elements 
for reference here soon, but while that's on the backburner, go into your
web browser's developer tools/console/source reader and check out 'normal.css'
definitions. It's not too complicated. If you do see anything redundant or stupid,
contact me either by sending a message via the 'Request Changes' option in the 
#options div, or email me at trandomii@gmail.com or on github. Thanks.
