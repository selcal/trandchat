<h4 style="background-color:#017E29">What commands are included with tr&chat?</h4>
<p>Here is a nice little reference you can use (it will be updated as more commands are implemented):</p>
<ul style="list-style:none">
<li><b>/roll /rawl /jimmyrollins</b><br> Arguably the most important and holy command, /roll /rolls a number given to us by the QUADSGODS and the Ancients. If you get repeating digits you have a large penis/breasts. You will also be lauded by various figures of great internet importance like Patrick Bateman. As an added bonus, people will tell tales about your >>88888888 GET to their children.</li>
<li><b>/clear /c</b><br> Clears the chat immediately on your end. Good for spam. Also, the X on the topbar does the same function.(Daily reminder: you can <i>disable 'Maximum Maymay Mode'</i> in the options if those memes get out of hand.)</li>
<li><b>/yt{paste url of youtube video}</b><br> Embeds a youtube video into the chat, given a valid URL. Just copy the URL and type in /yt and then paste. There is also a GUI version in the 'share' window, but this is quick and easy.</li>
<li><b>/web /www{paste url of website}</b><br> Embeds a website into the chat. Some websites <i>will not allow this feature</i> however. Good for posting threads on reddit or 8chan, and maybe sharing some news directly in the chat! (Also a GUI version in 'Share' window if you wish.)</li>
<li><b></b></li>
<li><b>/polska /sciernisko (or just type in 'kurwa')</b><br> Play a hideously low bitrate compressed version of the 'Polish National Anthem' for our fellow bracia in mother poland. (You can use <b>/c /clear</b> or the clear button (X) on the top bar to be a filthy american.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="background-color:#1C27D6">How do I call people in tr&chat?</h4>
<p>In the topbar, click the phone icon, and a panel will slide down. This is
the <i>call panel</i>. To begin a conference, simply click Host Call 
(or whatever I might rename it to). If someone has already started a call, 
all you have to do is open the call panel and you should join <b><i>automagically!</i></b>
To leave the call, press the leave call button <strike>duh</strike>.</p>
<h5 style="background-color:#1C27D6">Wait... how do I mute myself?</h5>
<p>When you connect to the call, you'll notice you have your own little box,
referred to henceforth as your <i>stream</i>. You can pause/click your stream
to effectively stop people from receiving your stream, hence muting yourself.
<h6>or...</h6> click the mute button. Heh.</p>
<h4 style="background-color:#8D00FF">How do I change how tr&chat looks like?</h4>
<p>Click the cog icon to open up the <i>Options Panel</i></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Select any of the premade styles in the Options Panel.</li>
		<li>Paste your own stylesheet into the <i>text area and then press the RICE! button to rice it up!</i></li>
		<li>Edit the CSS rules in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
<h4 style="background-color:#FF4400">Where can I find the source?</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/selcal/trandchat">Here you go, hosted on github.</a>
<h4 style="background-color:#009A7A">Where do I contact you?</h4>
<p>Contact me @ <b>selcal@protonmail.ch</b> if you have any questions or comments.
Or, y'know, post an 'issue' or comment on github. But I understand some people don't like/use github,
so that's cool.</p>
<h4 style="background-color:#007B4F">What license is this under?</h4>
<p>GPLv3. Use it however you wish.</p>
