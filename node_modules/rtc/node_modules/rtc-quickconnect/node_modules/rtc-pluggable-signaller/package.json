  "readme": "# rtc-pluggable-signaller\n\nBy using `rtc-pluggable-signaller` in your code, you provide the ability\nfor your package to customize which signalling client it uses (and\nthus have significant control) over how signalling operates in your\nenvironment.\n\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rtc-pluggable-signaller.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/rtc-pluggable-signaller/)\n\n[![stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)](https://github.com/dominictarr/stability#stable) \n[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/rtc-io.png)](https://gitter.im/rtc-io)\n\n\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe pluggable signaller looks in the provided `opts` for a `signaller`\nattribute.  If the value of this attribute is a string, then it is\nassumed that you wish to use the default\n[`rtc-signaller`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller) in your\npackage.  If, however, it is not a string value then it will be passed\nstraight back as the signaller (assuming that you have provided an\nobject that is compliant with the rtc.io signalling API).\n\n## License(s)\n\n### Apache 2.0\n\nCopyright 2013 - 2015 National ICT Australia Limited (NICTA)\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n",
