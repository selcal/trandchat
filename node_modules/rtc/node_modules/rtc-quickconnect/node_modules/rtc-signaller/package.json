  "readme": "# rtc-signaller\n\nThe `rtc-signaller` module provides a transportless signalling\nmechanism for WebRTC.\n\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rtc-signaller.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/rtc-signaller/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/rtc-io/rtc-signaller.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rtc-io/rtc-signaller) [![stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-stable-green.svg)](https://github.com/dominictarr/stability#stable) \n[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/rtc-io.png)](https://gitter.im/rtc-io)\n\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe signaller provides set of client-side tools that assist with the setting up an `PeerConnection` and helping them communicate. All that is required for the signaller to operate is a [suitable messenger](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/messenger-archetype).  A messenger is simply a function that is able to create a [pull-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream) `Source` and/or `Sink`.  From version `5.0.0` the `rtc-signaller` package will use pull-streams to ensure robust delivery of messages.\n\nBy using this approach, we can conduct signalling over any number of mechanisms:\n\n- local, [in memory](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/messenger-memory) message passing\n- via [WebSockets](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/messenger-ws) and higher level abstractions (such as [primus](https://github.com/primus/primus))\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhile the signaller is capable of communicating by a number of different\nmessengers (i.e. anything that can send and receive messages over a wire)\nit comes with support for understanding how to connect to an\n[rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard) out of the box.\n\nThe following code sample demonstrates how:\n\n```js\n// create a new signaller, connecting to the target switchboard\nvar messenger = require('rtc-switchboard-messenger');\nvar signaller = require('rtc-signaller')(messenger('//switchboard.rtc.io/'));\n\n// when a new peer is announced, log it\nsignaller.on('peer:announce', function(data) {\n console.log('new peer found in room: ', data);\n});\n\n// for our sanity, pop a message once we are connected\nsignaller.once('connected', function() {\n  console.log('we have successfully connected');\n});\n\n// send through an announce message\n// this will occur once the websocket has been opened and active\nsignaller.announce({ room: 'signaller-getting-started' });\n\n```\n\n## Signaller Events\n\nThere are a number of events that are generating throughout the lifecycle of a signaller.\n\n### Events regarding local state\n\nThe following events are generated by the signaller in response to updates n it's own state:\n\n- `connected`\n\n  A connection has been established via the underlying messenger to a signalling server (or equivalent).\n\n- `disconnected`\n\n  The connection has been lost (possibly temporarily) with the signalling server (or transport).  It is possible that the connection will be re-established so this does not necessarily mean the end.\n\n- `local:announce`\n\n  This event is trigged when an `/announce` message is sent via the messenging channel.  The event includes a single `data` argument which contains the object data that has been sent.\n\n### Events regarding peer state\n\nThe following events relate to information that has been relayed to this signaller about other peers:\n\n- `peer:filter`\n\n  The `peer:filter` event is triggered prior to the `peer:announce` or `peer:update` events being fired and provides an application the opportunity to reject a peer.  The handler for this event is passed the id of the peer that has connected to the room and a JS `data` object for the announce data. This data only differs from the `peer:announce` (or `peer:update`) data in that an `allow` attribute is included and controls whether we will acknowledge the presence of this new peer.\n\n  Due to the way event emitters behave in node, the last handler invoked is the authority on whether the peer is accepted or not (so make sure to check the previous state of the allow flag):\n\n  ```js\n  // only accept connections from Bob\n  signaller.on('peer:filter', function(id, data) {\n    data.allow = data.allow && (data.name === 'Bob');\n  });\n  ```\n\n- `peer:connected`\n\n  If a peer has passed the `peer:filter` test (either no filtering has been applied, or the allow flag is set to true in the filter events) then a `peer:connected` event will be emitted:\n\n  ```js\n  signaller.on('peer:connected', function(id) {\n    console.log('peer ' + id + ' has connected');\n  });\n  ```\n\n  This event can be useful if you wish to know when a peer has connected to the signalling server, and don't care whether it is a new peer (generating a `peer:announce` event) or known peer (generating a `peer:update` event).\n\n- `peer:announce`\n\n  While the `peer:connected` event is triggered each time a peer reconnects and announces to the signalling server, a `peer:announce` event is only emitted by your local signaller if this is considered a new connection from a peer.\n\n  If you are writing a WebRTC application, then this event is the best place to start creating `RTCPeerConnection` objects between the local machine and your remote, announced counterpart.  You will then be able to [couple](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#rtccouple) those connections together using the signaller.\n\n  ```js\n  signaller.on('peer:announce', function(data) {\n    console.log('discovered new peer: ' + data.id, data);\n\n    // TODO: create a peer connection with our new friend :)\n  });\n  ```\n\n- `peer:update`\n\n  An existing peer in the system has been \"re-announced\" possibly with some data changes:\n\n  ```js\n  signaller.on('peer:update', function(data) {\n    console.log('data update from peer: ' + data.id, data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n\n## Signal Flow Diagrams\n\nDisplayed below are some diagrams how the signalling flow between peers behaves.  In each of the diagrams we illustrate three peers (A, B and C) participating discovery and coordinating RTCPeerConnection handshakes.\n\nIn each case, only the interaction between the clients is represented not how a signalling server (such as [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard)) would pass on broadcast messages, etc.  This is done for two reasons:\n\n  1. It is out of scope of this documentation.\n  2. The `rtc-signaller` has been designed to work without having to rely on any intelligence in the server side signalling component.  In the instance that a signaller broadcasts all messages to all connected peers then `rtc-signaller` should be smart enough to make sure everything works as expected.\n\n### Peer Discovery / Announcement\n\nThis diagram illustrates the process of how peer `A` announces itself to peers `B` and `C`, and in turn they announce themselves.\n\n![](https://raw.github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller/master/docs/announce.png)\n\n### Editing / Updating the Diagrams\n\nEach of the diagrams has been generated using [mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/index.html) and the source for these documents can be found in the `docs/` folder of this repository.\n\n\n## Reference\n\nThe `rtc-signaller` module is designed to be used primarily in a functional\nway and when called it creates a new signaller that will enable\nyou to communicate with other peers via your messaging network.\n\n```js\n// create a signaller from something that knows how to send messages\nvar signaller = require('rtc-signaller')(messenger);\n```\n\nAs demonstrated in the getting started guide, you can also pass through\na string value instead of a messenger instance if you simply want to\nconnect to an existing `rtc-switchboard` instance.\n\n### `signaller.connect()`\n\nManually connect the signaller using the supplied messenger.\n\n__NOTE:__ This should never have to be called if the default setting\nfor `autoconnect` is used.\n\n### signaller#send(message, data*)\n\nUse the send function to send a message to other peers in the current\nsignalling scope (if announced in a room this will be a room, otherwise\nbroadcast to all peers connected to the signalling server).\n\n### announce(data?)\n\nThe `announce` function of the signaller will pass an `/announce` message\nthrough the messenger network.  When no additional data is supplied to\nthis function then only the id of the signaller is sent to all active\nmembers of the messenging network.\n\n#### Joining Rooms\n\nTo join a room using an announce call you simply provide the name of the\nroom you wish to join as part of the data block that you annouce, for\nexample:\n\n```js\nsignaller.announce({ room: 'testroom' });\n```\n\nSignalling servers (such as\n[rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard)) will then\nplace your peer connection into a room with other peers that have also\nannounced in this room.\n\nOnce you have joined a room, the server will only deliver messages that\nyou `send` to other peers within that room.\n\n#### Providing Additional Announce Data\n\nThere may be instances where you wish to send additional data as part of\nyour announce message in your application.  For instance, maybe you want\nto send an alias or nick as part of your announce message rather than just\nuse the signaller's generated id.\n\nIf for instance you were writing a simple chat application you could join\nthe `webrtc` room and tell everyone your name with the following announce\ncall:\n\n```js\nsignaller.announce({\n  room: 'webrtc',\n  nick: 'Damon'\n});\n```\n\n#### Announcing Updates\n\nThe signaller is written to distinguish between initial peer announcements\nand peer data updates (see the docs on the announce handler below). As\nsuch it is ok to provide any data updates using the announce method also.\n\nFor instance, I could send a status update as an announce message to flag\nthat I am going offline:\n\n```js\nsignaller.announce({ status: 'offline' });\n```\n\n### isMaster(targetId)\n\nA simple function that indicates whether the local signaller is the master\nfor it's relationship with peer signaller indicated by `targetId`.  Roles\nare determined at the point at which signalling peers discover each other,\nand are simply worked out by whichever peer has the lowest signaller id\nwhen lexigraphically sorted.\n\nFor example, if we have two signaller peers that have discovered each\nothers with the following ids:\n\n- `b11f4fd0-feb5-447c-80c8-c51d8c3cced2`\n- `8a07f82e-49a5-4b9b-a02e-43d911382be6`\n\nThey would be assigned roles:\n\n- `b11f4fd0-feb5-447c-80c8-c51d8c3cced2`\n- `8a07f82e-49a5-4b9b-a02e-43d911382be6` (master)\n\n### leave()\n\nTell the signalling server we are leaving.  Calling this function is\nusually not required though as the signalling server should issue correct\n`/leave` messages when it detects a disconnect event.\n\n### metadata(data?)\n\nGet (pass no data) or set the metadata that is passed through with each\nrequest sent by the signaller.\n\n__NOTE:__ Regardless of what is passed to this function, metadata\ngenerated by the signaller will **always** include the id of the signaller\nand this cannot be modified.\n\n### to(targetId)\n\nUse the `to` function to send a message to the specified target peer.\nA large parge of negotiating a WebRTC peer connection involves direct\ncommunication between two parties which must be done by the signalling\nserver.  The `to` function provides a simple way to provide a logical\ncommunication channel between the two parties:\n\n```js\nvar send = signaller.to('e95fa05b-9062-45c6-bfa2-5055bf6625f4').send;\n\n// create an offer on a local peer connection\npc.createOffer(\n  function(desc) {\n    // set the local description using the offer sdp\n    // if this occurs successfully send this to our peer\n    pc.setLocalDescription(\n      desc,\n      function() {\n        send('/sdp', desc);\n      },\n      handleFail\n    );\n  },\n  handleFail\n);\n```\n\n### signaller process handling\n\nWhen a signaller's underling messenger emits a `data` event this is\ndelegated to a simple message parser, which applies the following simple\nlogic:\n\n- Is the message a `/to` message. If so, see if the message is for this\n  signaller (checking the target id - 2nd arg).  If so pass the\n  remainder of the message onto the standard processing chain.  If not,\n  discard the message.\n\n- Is the message a command message (prefixed with a forward slash). If so,\n  look for an appropriate message handler and pass the message payload on\n  to it.\n\n- Finally, does the message match any patterns that we are listening for?\n  If so, then pass the entire message contents onto the registered handler.\n\n### signaller message handlers\n\n#### announce\n\n```\n/announce|%metadata%|{\"id\": \"...\", ... }\n```\n\nWhen an announce message is received by the signaller, the attached\nobject data is decoded and the signaller emits an `announce` message.\n\n## License(s)\n\n### Apache 2.0\n\nCopyright 2013 - 2014 National ICT Australia Limited (NICTA)\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n",
